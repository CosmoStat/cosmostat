/database                                                 December 2000

This subdirectory contains the IDL procedures, mostly written by Don Lindler,
(ACC/Goddard) to create and access an IDL database.   These database procedures
are currently used by the ASTRO-UIT, HST-GHRS, HST-STIS, ALEXIS and SOHO 
science teams.  The LaTex file database.tex in the /text directory describes 
the use of the database procedures with an emphasis on astronomical 
applications.     Further information on the database software is available 
in Chapter 3 and Appendix J of "A User's Guide to the GHRS Software" available
as a postscript file or as .html help from 
http://hrssun.gsfc.nasa.gov/daf/sw_docs.html

The database procedures require the non-standard system variables
!PRIV, !TEXTOUT, and !TEXTUNIT.   These can be added to the IDL session 
by using the procedure ASTROLIB.

Sample astronomical catalogs, formatted as IDL databases, are available in the
/zdbase directory.   These include the Yale Bright Star Catalog, the 
RC3 Galaxy catalog, and a catalog of HST observations.
