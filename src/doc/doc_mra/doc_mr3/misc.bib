Matching Pursuit Algorithm

The aim of time-frequency analysis is to offer the ability to analyze relatively long continuous
segments of seizure activity even when the dynamics of the signal are rapidly changing. One
approach to accurately analyze nonstationary signals such as the ictal EEG is to represent the
signal as a sum of waveforms with well-defined time-frequency properties. In Fourier analysis
these waveforms are cosines and sines which provide localization in frequency but not in time.
Gabor functions are the functions which best represent signals in the time-frequency domain in
the sense that they possess the smallest product of effective duration by effective frequency
width. 

A general family of time-frequency atoms can be generated by scaling, translating and
modulating a single window function g(t). For any scale s > 0, frequency modulationand
translation u, we denote= (s, u,) and define 



If g(t) is even, which is generally the case, g(t) is centered at the abscissa u. Its energy is mostly
concentrated in a neighborhood of u, whose size is proportional to s. The Fourier transform of
g(t)can be expressed by 



Becauseis even,is centered at the frequency=. Its energy is concentrated in a
neighborhood of, whose size is proportional to 1/s. 

In this study we used software implementation of the matching pursuit algorithm developed by
Mallat and Zhang (1993). We used a dictionary composed of Gabor functions supplemented with a
canonical basis of discrete Dirac functions and the discrete Fourier basis of cosine and sine
functions. This dictionary provides a richer collection of atomic waveforms which are located on a
much finer grid in time-frequency space than wavelet and cosine packet tables. The discrete
Gabor time-frequency atom is defined by 



where constant Ks normalizes the discrete norm of gs to 1, and , for 0 < p < N
and 0 < k < N. The discrete real Gabor dictionary is the set of all such atoms for s in (1, N) and p,
k are integers between 0 and N. Phase is recovered from computations with the related complex
Gabor atoms. 

We compute a linear expansion of signal f over a set of atoms selected from the dictionary, in
order to best match its inner structures. This is done by succesive approximations of f with
orthogonal projections on elements of the dictionary. After m iterations, a matching pursuit
decomposes a signal into 



where Rmf is the residual vector after m iterations, and <f, g> denotes inner product of functions
f and g. The Matching Pursuit algorithm at each step selects atom gn(t) , for which inner product
<Rnf, gn> is largest. 

To illustrate the decomposition into the time-frequency atoms we compute energy density defined
by 



where Wgn(t,) is the Wigner distribution of atom gn(t,). Unlike the Wigner and the Cohen
class distributions, it does not include cross terms. Energy distribution of atoms from our
dictionary are visible as horizontal lines for cosine functions, vertical lines for Dirac , or ellipses
with axes proportional to time and frequency spread for Gabor functions (Figure 1).
