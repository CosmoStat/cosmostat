    aim is to introduce and develop a cross-validation method for selecting
    a wavelet regression threshold that produces good estimates with respect
    to $L_2$ error.  The selected threshold determines which coefficients
    to keep in an orthogonal wavelet expansion of noisy data and acts in
    a similar way to a smoothing parameter in non-parametric regression." }

                 of length a power of 2. The cross-validation algorithm
                 is then extended to data sets of any length and to

  abstract =     "Adapted waveform analysis uses a library of
                 orthonormal bases and an efficiency functional to match
                 a basis to a given signal or family of signals. It
                 permits efficient compression of a variety of signals,
                 such as sound and images. The predefined libraries of
                 modulated waveforms include orthogonal wavelet-packets
                 and localized trigonometric functions, and have
                 reasonably well-controlled time-frequency localization
                 properties. The idea is to build out of the library
                 functions an orthonormal basis relative to which the
                 given signal or collection of signals has the lowest
                 information cost. The method relies heavily on the
                 remarkable orthogonality properties of the new
                 libraries: all expansions in a given library conserve
                 energy and are thus comparable. Several cost
                 functionals are useful; one of the most attractive is
                 Shannon entropy, which has a geometric interpretation
                 in this context.",
