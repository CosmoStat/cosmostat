Figures~\ref{fig_lenna_comp} and \ref{fig_land_comp} show filtered images
(Lena and the landscape image) using different methods. The upper left shows
the noisy image, after adding Gaussian noise ($\sigma=30$). The upper right,
lower left, and lower right show respectively the filtered image
by hard thresholding using FWT-7/9, by the multiscale entropy method,  
and by the combined method.


The combined filtering has in fact already been used by 
Donoho \cite{rest:donoho95},
when he repeated $n$ times the filtering operations by shifting its 1D
signal from one pixel at each operation. The border problem related 
to the shifting is managed by ``wrap-around'', --
the last pixel precedes the first.
All results were then averaged, and this effectively reduces the number
of artifacts. This approach however raises two problems: first,
it seems  difficult to extend it to 2D or 3D signals because the number
of filtering operations needed will become very high. Second, the way 
the boundary is managed can lead to significant artifacts if there is 
strong discontinuity
between the first pixels and the last ones, which is obviously possible in
practice 
(whenever there is a continuum or trend in the data).

The combined filtering proposed here is more general and it can be applied
whatever the size or the dimension of the signal. We have used here 
seven filterings, but this choice does not result from detailed study.
We plan in the future to analyze which combinations lead 
to the highest improvement.
