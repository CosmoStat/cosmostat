    a wavelet regression threshold that produces good estimates with respect

    to keep in an orthogonal wavelet expansion of noisy data and acts in
    a similar way to a smoothing parameter in non-parametric regression." }

                 a basis to a given signal or family of signals. It
                 permits efficient compression of a variety of signals,
                 such as sound and images. The predefined libraries of
                 modulated waveforms include orthogonal wavelet-packets
                 and localized trigonometric functions, and have
                 reasonably well-controlled time-frequency localization
                 properties. The idea is to build out of the library

                 given signal or collection of signals has the lowest

                 energy and are thus comparable. Several cost

                 a simple relationship between all multiresolution

                 the degrees of freedom remaining after fixing the

                 over these degrees of freedom to custom-design the
                 wavelet for a particular application. It also leads to
                 a faster implementation of the fast wavelet transform.

                 numerical analysis and signal processing. Their power
                 lies in the fact that they only require a small number
                 of coefficients to represent general functions and
                 large data sets accurately. This allows compression and
                 efficient computations. Classical constructions have
                 been limited to simple domains such as intervals and
                 rectangles. In this paper we present a wavelet
                 construction for scalar functions defined on the
                 sphere. We show how biorthogonal wavelets with custom
                 properties can be constructed with the lifting scheme.
                 The bases are extremely easy to implement and allofw
                 fully adaptive subdivisions. We give examples of
                 functions defined on the sphere, such as topographic
                 data, bi-directional reflection distribution functions,
                 and illumination, and show how they can be efficiently
