\chapter{Polarized Data}

\section{Introduction}
I 2

E 2
Polarized maps are a special kind of multi-dimentionnal datas with strong links between their components. The polarization is of great importance 
in physics or astrophysics as it's analysis denotes fundamentals characteristics of the observed object or phenomenum. An example of great interest 
D 2
is today the cosmic microwave background \citep{starck}.

is today the cosmic microwave background \citep{zalda,dasi}.\\

The statistical analysis of the slight intensity fluctuations in the primordial cosmic microwave background radiation field, for which evidence was 
found for the first time in the early 1990's in the observations made by COBE~\citep{gauss:smoot92}, is a major issue in modern cosmology as these 
are strongly related to the cosmological scenarios describing the properties and evolution of our Universe. In the Big Bang model, the observed CMB 
anisotropies are an imprint of primordial fluctuations in baryon-photon density from a time when the temperature of the Universe was high enough above 
3000~K for matter and radiation to be tightly coupled. At that time, the attraction of gravity and the repulsive radiation pressure were opposed, thus 
generating so-called acoustic oscillations in the baryon-photon fluid, causing peaks and troughs to appear in the power spectrum of the spatial anisotropies 
of the CMB. With the Universe cooling down as it expanded, matter and radiation finally decoupled. Photons were set free in a nearly transparent Universe, 
while the density fluctuations collapsed under the effect of gravity into large scale structures such as galaxies or clusters of galaxies. Due to the 
expansion of the Universe, the CMB photons are now observed in the microwave range but are still distributed according to an almost perfect black body 
emission law. Another major result was the measurement of the polarization state and anisotropies of the CMB radiation field by DASI~\citep{dasi}. 
Only a fraction of the total CMB radiation is polarized so that extremely sensitive instruments are needed. Polarization of the CMB radiation is a 
consequence of the Thomson scattering of photons on electrons. But for the outgoing population of photons to be polarized, the radiation incident on 
the scatterer needs to be anisotropic and have a quadrupole moment. The statistics of the CMB polarization anisotropies are also a source of information 
for cosmology. Inference of cosmological parameters from the joint statistics of the CMB anisotropies should benefit from both the complementarity and 
the redundancy of the information carried by the additional measurement of CMB polarization. Hence the full-sky maps with unprecedented sensitivity and 
angular resolution of both temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB to be delivered by the upcoming Planck Surveyor satellite experiment are 
awaited with excitement.

Full-sky CMB polarization data, as expected from the upcoming Planck experiment, consists of measurements of the Stokes parameters so that in addition 
to the temperature $T$ map, $Q$ and $U$ maps are given as well. The fourth Stokes parameter commonly denoted $V$ is a measure of circular polarization. 
In the case of CMB which is not expected to have circularly polarized anisotropies, $V$ vanishes. The former three quantities, $T$, $Q$ and $U$ then 
fully describe the linear polarization state of the CMB radiation incident along some radial line of sight : $T$ is the total incoming intensity, $Q$ is 
the difference between the intensities transmitted by two perfect orthogonal polarizers the directions of which define a reference frame in the tangent 
plane, and $U$ is the same as $Q$ but with polarizers rotated 45 degrees in that tangent plane. Clearly, $Q$ and $U$ are not invariant through a rotation 
of angle $\phi$ of the local reference frame around the line of sight. In fact, it is easily shown that~:
\begin{eqnarray}
Q ' = & \cos (2 \phi) Q + \sin(2 \phi) U \\ \nonumber
U ' = & \cos (2 \phi) U - \sin(2 \phi) Q 
\end{eqnarray}
which can also be written $Q' \pm i U' = e^{\mp i\phi} ( Q \pm i U )$ which by definition expresses the fact that the quantities $Q \pm i U$ are 
spin-2 fields on the sphere. The suitable generalization of the Fourier representation for such fields is the spin-2 spherical harmonics basis 
denoted $_{\pm 2}Y_{\ell m}$, in which we can expand~: 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{QU}
Q \pm i U  = \sum_{\ell, m} { _{\pm 2}a_{\ell m}} {_{\pm 2}Y_{\ell m} }
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Multiscale Representation}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig_pola_qu_owt_trans.png}
\caption{Q-U orthogonal Wavelet Transform.}
\label{fig_qu_owt_trans}
\end{figure}

The easiest way to build a multiscale transform for polarized data is to use the Healpix\footnote{http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov} 
representation \citep{pixel:healpix}, and to apply a bi-orthogonal wavelet transform on each face of the Healpix map, separately for $Q$ and $U$.
Fig.~\ref{fig_qu_owt_trans} shows the flow-graph of this Q-U orthogonal wavelet transform (QU-OWT). Recall that the base resolution of the Healpix 
representation divides the sphere into twelve curvilinear quadrilateral faces of equal area placed on three rings around the poles and equator. 
Each face is subsequently divided into $nside^{2}$ pixels of exactly equal surface but with varying shape. It follows that $Q$ and $U$ are 
reconstructed at position $k$ from their wavelet coefficients $w_{j,p}^Q$, $w_{j,p}^U$, $c^Q_{J,p}$ and $c^U_{J,p}$ according to~: 
%described from their wavelet coefficients as:
  \begin{eqnarray}
 Q_k &  =  &  \sum_p c^Q_{J,p} \phi_{j,k}(p) + \sum_p \sum_{j=1}^J \psi_{j,k}(p)w_{j,p}^Q \\ \nonumber
 U_k  & =  &  \sum_p c^U_{J,p} \phi_{j,k}(p) + \sum_p \sum_{j=1}^J \psi_{j,k}(p)w_{j,p}^U
 \end{eqnarray}
which can also be written as:
 \begin{eqnarray}
(Q \pm iU)_k & =  & \sum_p (c^Q_{J,p} \pm i c^U_{J,p}) \phi_{j,k}(p) + \nonumber \\
                      &  &  \sum_p \sum_{j=1}^J \psi_{j,k}(p) ( w_{j,p}^Q \pm i w_{j,p}^U )
\label{eq_qu_owt}
\end{eqnarray}
This wavelet transform is not redundant \textit{i.e.} the decomposition has the same number of coefficients as the input data, and it is invertible so that the $Q$ and $U$ maps can be reconstructed exactly.\\
%Since the bi-orthogonal wavelet transform is reversible,
%we can reconstruct perfectly reconstruct the $Q$ and $U$ maps from their wavelet coefficients.

\caption{ \textit{Top~:} examples of backprojections of Q-wavelet coefficients. \textit{Bottom~:} examples of backprojections of U-wavelet coefficients.}
\label{fig_qu_owt_back}
\end{figure}

When we apply such a decomposition, we implicitly use a  dictionary $\Phi$ on which we project the data.
As discussed previously, the shape of the dictionary elements, also called atoms, is very important to have 
an efficient analysis of the data. In the case of polarized data, it is not straightforward to imagine these 
shapes from Eq.~\eqref{eq_qu_owt}. In order to visualize them, we can perform a backprojection \textit{i.e.}
we apply the inverse wavelet transform to sets of wavelet coefficients where only one coefficient is different from zero. 
Repeating the same experiment, changing only the scale and position of the non-zero coefficient allows us 
to view the different atoms in the dictionary related to the  QU-OWT transform that we use. Fig.~\ref{fig_qu_owt_back} shows 
examples of backprojections of $Q$ wavelet coefficients (top) and backprojections of $U$ wavelet coefficients (bottom).
The shapes of the individual atoms do not look close to the astronomical patterns we would expect in our data. 
Therefore, this decomposition may not be optimal to analyze polarized astronomical data, although this would need 
to be confirmed in practice. The following sections describe other polarized wavelet transforms with different morphological properties.

\section{Module-phase non linear multiscale transform}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{sec:modphase}

\subsection{Introduction}
Given a polarized map in the standard Q-U representation, consider a different point of view and define the modulus $M$ and phase $P$ maps as follows~:
%
%From a different point of view, the combined $Q$ and $U$ maps can be considered as a vector field. Let define such combined map $\mathcal{V}$ as follows~:
%\begin{equation}
%{\mathcal{V}} = \left[ Q \, U\right]
%\end{equation}
%Each pixel of $\mathcal{V}$ is then vector valued. A classical approach amounts to decomposing each vector into its modulus and phase part. $\mathcal{V}$ can then be decomposed into a modulus map $M$ and a phase map $P$~:
\begin{eqnarray}
\forall k,\,\,\, M_k & = & \sqrt{Q_k^2 +  U_k^2} \\
\forall k,\,\,\, P_k & = & \exp(i \theta_k) \mbox{ where } tan(\theta_k) = U_k/Q_k 
\end{eqnarray}
Because the smoothness of the $Q$ and $U$ maps should result in some smoothness of the modulus map $M$ and the phase map $P$, 
one may consider devising a multiscale modulus/phase decomposition of the spin 2 field ${\mathcal{V}} = \left[ Q \, U\right]$.\\

The specificity of the modulus/phase decomposition of $\mathcal{V}$ is twofold~: i) the modulus field is non-negative and ii) the phase

field takes its values on the unit circle $S^1$. Recently, \cite{rahman05} introduced a multiscale analysis technique for manifold valued

\end{figure*}
Let us provide some essential notation~: we assume that the entries of the phase map $P$ lie in a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ 
D 2
(\textit{e.g.} $\mathcal{M}\equiv S^1$). According to \cite{rahman05}, take $p_0,p_1 \in \mathcal{M}$ and define $Log_{p_0}(p_1)$ 
E 2
I 2
(\textit{e.g.} $\mathcal{M}\equiv S^1$). According to \citep{rahman05}, take $p_0,p_1 \in \mathcal{M}$ and define $Log_{p_0}(p_1)$ 
E 2
as the log-map of $p_1$ onto the tangent space $\mathcal{T}_{p_0}$ of $\mathcal{M}$ at $p_0$. The back-projection is obtained 
using the inverse of the log-map $Exp_{p_0}$. \footnote{In differential geometry, the Exp map and Log map are generalizations of 
the usual exponential and logarithm function. Here the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ is a Riemannian manifold. In that case, the Exp map 
at point $p_0$, $Exp_{p_0}(s)$ is the map which takes a vector $s$ of the tangent space of $\mathcal{M}$ at $p_0$ and provides the 
point $p_1$ by travelling along the geodesic starting at $p_0$ in the direction s.}\\
For instance, if we choose $\mathcal{M} \equiv S^1$ then $p_0 = \exp(i \theta_0)$ and $p_1 = \exp(i \theta_1)$. The $Exp_{p_0}$ and 
$Log_{p_0}$ maps are then defined as follows~:
\begin{eqnarray}
\forall p_1 \in S^, \,\,\,  Log_{p_0} (p_1) & = & \theta_1 - \theta_0 \\
\forall s \in \mathbb{R} \,\,\, Exp_{p_0} (s) & = & exp(i(\theta_0 + s))

The multiscale transform for manifold valued data introduced in \citep{rahman05} is equivalent to a two-step interpolation-refinement 
scheme similar to the lifting scheme described in~\citep{wave:sweldens98}. The wavelet coefficients and low pass approximation pixels 
E 2
are then computed as follows at each scale $j$ and pixel $k$~:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:mani}
w_{j+1,k}^P & = & Log_{c_{j,2k+1}^P}\left(\mathcal{P}(c_{j,2k}^P)\right)   \\
c_{j+1,k}^P & = & Exp_{c_{j,2k}^P} ( -\mathcal{U}(w_{j+1,k}^P))
\label{eq:mani2}
\end{eqnarray}
The wavelet coefficient $w_{j+1,k}^P$ at pixel $k$ and scale $j$ is the projection of its prediction/interpolation $\mathcal{P}(c_{j,2k}^P)$ 
onto the tangent space $\mathcal{T}_{c_{j,2k+1}^P}$ of $\mathcal{M}$ at $c_{j,2k+1}^P$. The low pass approximation $c_{j+1,k}^P$ at scale $j+1$ 
D 2
is computed by updating $c_{j,2k}^P$ from the wavelet coefficient $w_{j+1,k}^P$.\\
E 2
I 2
is computed by updating $c_{j,2k}^P$ from the wavelet coefficient $w_{j+1,k}^P$.

E 2
The main advantage of this scheme is its ability to capture local regularities while guaranteeing the low pass approximation to belong to 
the manifold $\mathcal{M}$. Indeed, the wavelet coefficient $w_{j+1,k}^P$ at pixel $k$ and scale $j+1$ is computed as the $Exp$ map at 
D 2
$c_{j,2k+1}^P$ of an approximation $\mathcal{P}(c_{j,2k}^P)$ of $c_{j,2k}^P$.\\
E 2
I 2
$c_{j,2k+1}^P$ of an approximation $\mathcal{P}(c_{j,2k}^P)$ of $c_{j,2k}^P$.

E 2
Note also that even if the definitions of the $Exp_{p_0}$ and $Log_{p_0}$ maps involve the absolute phase $\theta(k)$ (\textit{i.e.} $tan(\theta(k)) = U_k/Q_k$), 
at least they only require the computation of differences of phases values thus avoiding the explicit manipulation of an absolute phase.\\
However the non-linearity of the proposed transform is a major drawback when considering denoising and restoration applications.\\ 

\paragraph{Illustration~:\\}
In the case of polarized data, the entries of the phase map $P$ lie in $\mathcal{M} \equiv S^1$. In the following experiments, $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ are chosen such that~:
\begin{eqnarray}
w_{j+1}^P & = & Log_{c_{j,2k+1}^P}(c_{j,2k}^P)  \\
c_{j+1,k}^P & = & Exp_{c_{j,2k}^P} \left( - \frac{w_{j+1}^P}{2}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
This multiscale transform is invertible and its inverse is computed as follows~:
\begin{eqnarray}
c_{j,2k}^P & = & Exp_{c_{j+1,k}^P} \left(\frac{w_{j+1}^P}{2}\right)\\
c_{j,2k+1}^P & = & Exp_{c_{j,2k}^P}\left( w_{j+1}^P \right)   
\end{eqnarray}
The picture in Figure~\ref{fig_modphase_back} features some examples of backprojections of MP-multiscale coefficients.

ii) analyzing the phase map P using an extension to the undecimated case of the multiscale transform described in \citep{rahman05}. In that case, Equations~\eqref{eq:mani} 
E 2
and \eqref{eq:mani2} are replaced with the following equations~:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:maniu}
c_{j+1,k}^P & = & Exp_{c_{j,k}^P} ( \mathcal{F}(c_{j,.}^P))\\
w_{j+1}^P & = & Log_{c_{j+1,k}^P}\left(c_{j,k}^P\right)  
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathcal{F}(c_{j,.}^P) = \sum_l h_{l} Log_{c_{j,k}}\left(c_{j,k-2^jl}\right)$ with $\sum_l h_l = 1$ and $h_l > 0$. The low pass 
approximation $c_{j+1,k}^P$ is then computed from a linear combination (linear filter) of a neighborhood $\{c_{j,k-2^jl}\}_l$ of $c_{j,k}$ 
weighted by the positive scalars $\{h_l\}_l$. Note that from scale $j$ to scale $j+1$, the spatial size of the neighborhood increases 
by a factor $2$ which would be equivalent to downsize by a factor $2$ the band pass filter of the classical wavelet decomposition scheme.\\

\subsection{Example}
In the case of polarized data, the entries of the phase map $P$ lie in $\mathcal{M} \equiv S^1$. In the following experiments, $\mathcal{F}$ is chosen such that~:
\begin{eqnarray}
c_{j+1,k}^P & = & Exp_{c_{j,k}^P}\left(\sum_l h_{l}Log_{c_{j,k}}\left(c_{j,k-2^jl}^P\right)\right)  \\
w_{j+1,k}^P & = & Exp_{c_{j,k}^P} \left(c_{j+1,k}^P\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where~:
\begin{equation}
h_l = \left\{
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & \mbox{ if } & l < -2 \mbox{ or } l > 2 \\
1/16 &\mbox{ if }& l=-2 \mbox{ or } l=2 \\
1/4 &\mbox{ if }& l=-1 \mbox{ or } l=1\\
3/8 &\mbox{ if }& l= 0
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
This multiscale transform is invertible and its inverse is computed as follows~:
\begin{equation}
 c_{j,k}^P  =  Exp_{c_{j+1,k}^P } \left(- w_{j+1,k}^P\right)  
\end{equation}

which depends only on colatitude $\vartheta$ and is invariant with respect to a change in longitude $\varphi$. It follows that 
the spherical harmonic coefficients $\hat \phi_{l_c} (l,m)$ of $\phi_{l_c}$ vanish when $m \ne 0$ which makes it simple to compute 
those spherical harmonic coefficients $\hat c_{0}(l,m)$ of $c_0 = \phi_{l_c} * f$ where $*$ stands for convolution :

\subsection{Extension to Polarized Data}
By applying the above scalar isotropic wavelet transform to each component $T$, $Q$, $U$ of a polarized map on the sphere, we have~:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{tqu_iwt}
T(\vartheta, \varphi) & = c_{J}^T (\vartheta, \varphi)+ \sum_{j=1}^{J} w_j^T  (\vartheta, \varphi)\\ \nonumber
Q(\vartheta, \varphi) & = c_{J}^Q (\vartheta, \varphi)+ \sum_{j=1}^{J} w_j^Q (\vartheta, \varphi)\\ \nonumber
U(\vartheta, \varphi) & = c_{J}^U (\vartheta, \varphi)+ \sum_{j=1}^{J} w_j^U (\vartheta, \varphi)
\end{eqnarray}
where $c_{J}^X$ stands for the low resolution approximation to component $X$ and $w_j^X$ is the map of wavelet coefficients of that component on scale $j$. This leads to the following decomposition~:
\begin{eqnarray}
(Q \pm iU)[k] =    (c^Q_{J} \pm c^U_{J,p})[k]   +   \sum_{j=1}^J   ( w_{j}^Q \pm w_{j}^U )[k]
\label{eq_qu_rec_uwt}
\end{eqnarray}
Fig.\ref{fig_qu_iwt_back} shows the backprojection of a Q-wavelet coefficient (left) and a $U$-wavelet coefficient (right).

The digital curvelet transform on the sphere is clearly invertible in the sense that each step of the overall transform is itself invertible. 
The curvelet transform on the sphere has a redundancy factor of $16J + 1$ when $J$ scales are used, which may be a problem for handling huge data sets 
such as from the future Planck-Surveyor experiment. This can be reduced by substituting the pyramidal wavelet transform to the undecimated wavelet

\section{Polarized E/B Wavelet and E/B Curvelet}
\label{sec:pol_eb}

\subsection{Introduction}
We have seen that the generalization of the Fourier representation for polarized data on the sphere is the spin-2 spherical harmonics basis denoted $_{\pm 2}Y_{\ell m}$: 
\begin{equation} 
Q \pm i U  = \sum_{\ell, m}  { _{\pm 2}a_{\ell m}}   {_{\pm 2}Y_{\ell m} }
\end{equation} 
  
D 2
At this point, it is convenient~\cite{zalda} to introduce the two quantities denoted $E$ and $B$ which are defined on the sphere by

I 2
At this point, it is convenient~\citep{zalda} to introduce the two quantities denoted $E$ and $B$ which are defined on the sphere by 
E 2
\begin{eqnarray}\label{EB}
E = &  \sum_{\ell, m}   a_{\ell m} ^E Y_{\ell m} =  \sum_{\ell, m}  - \frac{ 1}{2}   ({_{ 2}a_{\ell m}}  +  {_{- 2}a_{\ell m}} )    Y_{\ell m} \\ \nonumber
B = & \sum_{\ell, m}   a_{\ell m} ^B Y_{\ell m} =  \sum_{\ell, m}  i \frac{ 1}{2}    ({_{ 2}a_{\ell m}}  -  {_{- 2}a_{\ell m}} )   Y_{\ell m} 
\end{eqnarray} 
%\begin{equation}\label{EB}
%E =  \sum_{\ell, m}   a_{\ell m} ^E Y_{\ell m} =  \sum_{\ell, m}  - \frac{   {_{ 2}a_{\ell m}}  +  {_{- 2}a_{\ell m}}  }  {2}  Y_{\ell m}  \quad \quad 
%B =  \sum_{\ell, m}   a_{\ell m} ^B Y_{\ell m} =  \sum_{\ell, m}  i \frac{   {_{ 2}a_{\ell m}}  -  {_{- 2}a_{\ell m}}  }  {2}   Y_{\ell m} 
%\end{equation} 
where $Y_{\ell m}$ stands for the usual spin 0 spherical harmonics basis functions. The quantities $E$ and $B$ are derived by applying 
the spin lowering operator twice to $Q + i U$  and the spin raising operator twice to $Q - i U$ so that $E$ and $B$ are real scalar 
fields on the sphere, invariant through rotations of the local reference frame. The normalization of $a_{\ell m} ^E$ and $a_{\ell m} ^B$ 
D 2
chosen in the latter definition is purely conventional but it appears to be rather popular~\cite{1997PhRvD..55.1830Z,2003PhRvD..67b3501B}.

Still, we could multiply $a_{\ell m} ^E$ and $a_{\ell m} ^B$ by some $A_{\ell}$ and we would have just as good a representation of the initial 
polarization maps. Through a change of parity $E$ will remain invariant whereas the sign of pseudo-scalar $B$ will change. The $E$ and $B$ 
D 2
modes defined here are not so different from the \emph{gradient} (\emph{i.e. curl} free) and \emph{curl} (\emph{i.e. divergence} free) components 
E 2
I 2
modes defined here are not so different from the gradient (i.e. curl free) and curl (i.e. divergence free) components 
E 2
encountered in the analysis of vector fields. Finally, the spatial anisotropies of the Gaussian CMB temperature and polarization fields are 
completely characterized in this new linear representation by the power spectra and cross spectra of $T$, $E$ and $B$. Thanks to the different 
parities of $T$ and $E$ on one side and $B$ on the other, the sufficient statistics reduce to only four spectra namely $C_\ell^{EE}, C_\ell^{TE}, 
C_\ell^{TT}, C_\ell^{BB}$. For a given cosmological model, it is possible to give a theoretical prediction of these spectra. Aiming at inverting 
the model and inferring the cosmological parameters, an important goal of CMB temperature and polarization data analysis is then to estimate the 
latter power spectra, based on sampled, noisy sometimes incomplete $T$, $Q$ and $U$ spherical maps.  

\subsection{E/B Isotropic Wavelet}
Following the above idea of representing CMB polarization maps by means of $E$ and $B$ modes, we propose a formal extension of the previous 
undecimated isotropic wavelet transform that will allow us to handle linear polarization data maps $T$, $Q$ and $U$ on the sphere. Practically, 
the maps we consider are pixelized using for instance the Healpix pixelization scheme. In fact, we are not concerned at this point with the 
recovery of E and B modes from pixelized or incomplete data maps which itself is not a trivial task. The extension of the wavelet transform 
on the sphere we describe here makes use of the $E$ and $B$ representation of polarized maps described above in a formal way. Given polarization 
data maps $T$, $Q$ and $U$, the proposed wavelet transform algorithm consists of the following steps :

\item Apply the undecimated isotropic transform on the sphere described above to map $T$ and to the $E$, $B$ representation of the polarization maps.

The wavelet coefficient maps  $w_j^T$, $w_j^E$, $w_j^B$ and the low resolution approximation maps $c_J^T$, $c_J^E$, $c_J^B$ are obtained by applying 
the isotropic undecimated wavelet transform described in section~\ref{sec:UWTS} to the $T$, $E$, $B$ representation of the polarized data. Figure~\ref{fig:UWTSpol}

in a four scale decomposition. The scaling function we used is a cubic box spline as proposed in section~\ref{sec:UWTS}. The wavelet coefficients were 
obtained as the difference between two successive low pass approximations of the multiresolution decomposition of the $E$ and $B$ maps. The proper choice 
for the scaling and wavelet functions will depend on the application and the existence of constraints to be enforced.

Obviously, the transform described above is invertible and the inverse transform is readily obtained by applying the inverse 
of each of the three steps in reverse order. If, as in the example decomposition above, we take the wavelet function to be 
the difference between two successive low pass approximations, the third step is inverted by simply summing the last low pass

In order to be more quantitative, we used two test images (synchrotron and dust) with different noise levels. The noise levels were taken equal to $0.1,0.2,0.5,1.$ and $2$ times the standard deviation of the noise-free image.
On each noisy image, we applied six different transformations, thresholded  the coefficients and reconstructed the filtered images. The transforms we used are the QU-wavelets  (QU-UWT), 
the EB-wavelets (EB-UWT), the QU-curvelet  (QU-CUR),  the EB-curvelet (EB-CUR), the biorthogonal wavelet transform (OWT) and the modulus-phase undecimated multiscale transform (MP-UWT).

For each filtered image  $Q$  (resp. $U$), we computed the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB~:
\begin{equation}
E  = 10 \log_{10}(  \sigma_I^2 /  \sigma_e^2 )
\end{equation}
D 2
where $\sigma_I$ is the standard deviation  of the noise free original image component $Q$ (resp. $U$) and $\sigma_e$ is the standard deviation of the error image \textit{i.e.} the difference between the noise-free component $Q$  (resp. $U$) and the filtered component  $Q$  (resp. $U$). These errors are given in Table~(\ref{tab_psnr_pol_dust}) for the dust image and in Table~(\ref{tab_psnr_pol_sync}) for the synchrotron image.

It is clear from the above results that the different transforms described here do not perform as well on this specific numerical experiment. For the dust, QU-wavelets are better when the noise level is not so high, while curvelets do better when the noise and signal levels are of the same order. This can be explained by the fact that structures on small scales are more or less isotropic, and therefore 
better represented by wavelets, while large scale structures are anisotropic and therefore better analyzed using curvelets. When increasing the noise level, structures on the smallest scales are no longer detected by either of the two dictionaries. Only large scale features are detectable, and curvelets do this job better. Dealing with the polarized synchrotron map, curvelets  do better than wavelets in all cases experimented with here. Although the bi-orthogonal wavelet transform is clearly not as good as the others in these experiments, it could nevertheless be very useful in situations where computation time is an important issue. Indeed, since it doesn't make use of the spherical harmonics transform and also because it is not redundant, it is a very fast transform.
Finally the worse results were obtained using the Modulus-Phase multiscale transform. This can be explained by the fact that the Gaussian approximation we made for the noise in the wavelet transform of the modulus  is not accurate enough. Furthermore, it is not clear what is the best way to correct the phase wavelet coefficients from the noise. A better understanding of the noise behavior after transformation is clearly required before the Mod-Phase multiscale transform can be used for restoration purposes. However, for other applications such as non-Gaussianity studies, the latter transform could prove an interesting tool to use as well.

explained by the fact that structures on small scales are more or less isotropic, and therefore better 
represented by wavelets, while large scale structures are anisotropic and therefore better analyzed 
using curvelets. When increasing the noise level, structures on the smallest scales are no longer detected 
by either of the two dictionaries. Only large scale features are detectable, and curvelets do this job better. 
Dealing with the polarized synchrotron map, curvelets do better than wavelets in all cases experimented with here. 
Although the bi-orthogonal wavelet transform is clearly not as good as the others in these experiments, 
it could nevertheless be very useful in situations where computation time is an important issue. Indeed, since it 
doesn't make use of the spherical harmonics transform and also because it is not redundant, it is a very fast transform.
Finally the worse results were obtained using the Modulus-Phase multiscale transform. This can be explained 
by the fact that the Gaussian approximation we made for the noise in the wavelet transform of the modulus 
is not accurate enough. Furthermore, it is not clear what is the best way to correct the phase wavelet 
coefficients from the noise. A better understanding of the noise behavior after transformation is clearly 
required before the Mod-Phase multiscale transform can be used for restoration purposes. However, for other 
applications such as non-Gaussianity studies, the latter transform could prove an interesting tool to use as well.
