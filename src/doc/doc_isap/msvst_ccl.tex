% \markright{Conclusion}

We have presented recent methods for restoration of spherical data with noise following a Poisson distribution. A denoising method was proposed, which used a variance stabilization method and multiscale transforms on the sphere.
Experiments have shown it is very efficient for the denoising of  astrophysical data set such as Fermi data.  Two spherical multiscale transforms, the wavelet and the curvelets, were used.
Then, we have described an extension of the denoising method in order to take into account missing data, and we have shown that this inpainting method
could be a useful tool to estimate the diffuse emission. 
Then, we have introduced a new denoising method the sphere which takes into account a background model. The simulated data have shown that it is relatively robust to
errors in the model, and can therefore be used for diffuse background modeling and source detection.
Finally, an extension to multichannel denoising and deconvolution has been proposed, which proved very efficient on simulated data.
