\chapter{The Combined Filtering Method}
 
In general, suppose that we are given $K$ linear transforms $T_1,
\ldots, T_K$ and let $\alpha_k$ be the coefficient sequence of an
object $x$ after applying the transform $T_k$, i.e. $\alpha_k = T_k
x$. We will assume that for each transform $T_k$ we have available a
reconstruction rule that we will denote by $T^{-1}_k$ although this is
clearly an abuse of notation.  Finally, $T$ will denote the block
diagonal matrix with the $T_k$'s as building blocks and $\alpha$ the
amalgamation of the $\alpha_k$'s.

A hard thresholding rule associated with the transform $T_k$ synthesizes 
an estimate $\tilde{s}_k$ via the formula 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ht}
\tilde{s}_k = T_k^{-1} \delta(\alpha_k)
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is a rule that sets to zero all the coordinates of
$\alpha_k$ whose absolute value falls below a given sequence of
thresholds (such coordinates are said to be non-significant).
 
Given data $y$ of the form $y = s + \sigma z$, where $s$ is the image
we wish to recover and $z$ is standard white noise, we propose solving
the following optimization problem \cite{starck:spie01a}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:l1-min}
  \min \|T\tilde{s}\|_{\ell_1}, \quad \mbox{subject to} \quad s \in C,  
\end{equation}
where $C$ is the set of vectors $\tilde{s}$ 
which obey the linear constraints
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:constraints}
\left\{  \begin{array}{ll}
  \tilde{s} \ge 0, \\
  |T\tilde{s} - Ty| \le e; 
  \end{array}
  \right. 
\end{equation}
here, the second inequality constraint 
only concerns the set of significant coefficients, 
i.e. those indices $\mu$ such that $\alpha_\mu =
(Ty)_\mu$ exceeds (in absolute value) a threshold $t_\mu$. Given a
vector of tolerance $(e_\mu)$, we seek a solution whose coefficients
  $(T\tilde{s})_\mu$ are within $e_\mu$ of the noisy
empirical $\alpha_\mu$'s.  Think of $\alpha_\mu$ as being given by
\[
y = \langle y, \varphi_\mu \rangle, 
\]
so that $\alpha_\mu$ is normally distributed with mean $\langle f,
\varphi_\mu \rangle$ and variance $\sigma^2_\mu = \sigma^2
\|\varphi_\mu\|^2_2$. In practice, the threshold values range
typically between three and four times the noise level $\sigma_\mu$
and in our experiments we will put $e_\mu = \sigma_\mu/2$. In short,
our constraints guarantee that the reconstruction will take into
account any pattern which is detected as significant by  any of the
$K$ transforms.
   
\subsubsection*{The Minimization Method}

We propose solving (\ref{eq:l1-min}) using the method of hybrid
steepest descent (HSD) \cite{wave:yamada01}. HSD consists of building
the sequence
\begin{eqnarray}
 s^{n+1} = P(s^{n}) - \lambda_{n+1} \nabla_J(P(s^{n})); 
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $P$ is the $\ell_2$ projection operator onto the feasible set
$C$, $\nabla_J$ is the gradient of equation~\ref{eq:l1-min}, and
$(\lambda_{n})_{n \ge 1}$ is a sequence obeying $(\lambda_{n})_{n\ge
  1} \in [0,1] $ and $\lim_{ n \rightarrow + \infty } \lambda_{n} = 0$.

The combined filtering algorithm is:
\begin{enumerate}
\baselineskip=0.4truecm
\itemsep=0.1truecm
\item Initialize $L_{\max} = 1$, the number of iterations $N_i$, and
  $\delta_{\lambda} = \frac{L_{\max}}{N_i}$.
\item Estimate the noise standard deviation $\sigma$, and set $e_k =
  \frac{\sigma}{2}$.
\item For k = 1, .., $K$ calculate the transform: $\alpha^{(s)}_k
  = T_k s$.
\item Set $\lambda = L_{\max}$, $n = 0$, and $\tilde s^{n}$ to 0.
\item While $\lambda >= 0$ do
\begin{itemize}
\item $u = \tilde s^{n}$.
\item For k = 1, .., $K$ do
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Calculate the transform $\alpha_{k} = T_k u$.
  \item For all coefficients $\alpha_{k,l}$ do
     \begin{itemize}
     \item Calculate the residual $r_{k,l} = \alpha^{(s)}_{k,l} -
       \alpha_{k,l}$
       
     \item if $\alpha^{(s)}_{k,l}$ is significant and $ \mid r_{k,l}
       \mid > e_{k,l}$ then $\alpha_{k,l} = \alpha^{(s)}_{k,l}$
     \item $\alpha_{k,l} = sgn(\alpha_{k,l}) ( \mid \alpha_{k,l} \mid - \lambda)_{+}$.
     \end{itemize}
   \item $u = T_k^{-1} \alpha_{k}$
  \end{itemize}
\item Threshold negative values in $u$ and $\tilde s^{n+1} = u$.
\item $n = n + 1$, $\lambda = \lambda - \delta_{\lambda} $, and goto 5.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
