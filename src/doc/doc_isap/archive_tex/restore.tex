\section{Introduction}
\index{wavelet!denoising}
\index{curvelet!denoising}

Wavelets and Curvelets have been used successfully for image denoising \emph{via} non-linear filtering or 
thresholding methods \cite{starck:book02,starck:sta01_3}. Hard thresholding, for instance, consists in 
setting all insignificant coefficients (\emph{i.e.} coefficients with an absolute value below a given 
threshold) to zero. In practice, we need to estimate the noise standard deviation $\sigma_j$ in each band 
$j$ and a wavelet (or curvelet) coefficient $w_j$ is significant if $\mid w_j \mid > k \sigma_j$, where $k$ 
is a user-defined parameter, typically chosen between 3 and 5. The $\sigma_j$ estimation in band $j$ can be 
derived from simulations \cite{starck:book02}. Denoting $D$ the noisy data and $\delta$ the thresholding 
operator, the filtered data $\tilde D$ are obtained by : 
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\tilde D} =    {\cal R} \delta( {\cal T} D)
\end{eqnarray}
where ${\cal T}$ is the wavelet (resp. curvelet) transform operator and ${\cal R}$ is the wavelet (resp. curvelet) reconstruction operator. 


\section{Significant Wavelet Coefficients}
\label{ch_noise}
\subsection{Definition}
\index{noise}
\index{wavelet!significant coefficient}

In most applications, it is necessary to know if a wavelet coefficient is due to signal (i.e.\ it is significant) or to noise. 

The wavelet (resp. curvelet) transform yields a set of resolution-related views of the input image. 
A wavelet (resp. curvelet) band at level $j$ has coefficients given by $w_{j,k}$. If we obtain the 
distribution of the coefficient $w_{j,k}$ for each band of the decomposition, based on the noise, 
we can introduce a statistical significance test for this coefficient. This procedure is the classical 
significance-testing one. Let ${\cal H}_0$ be the hypothesis that the image is locally constant at scale $j$.  
Rejection of hypothesis ${\cal H}_0$ depends (for positive coefficient values) on:
\begin{eqnarray}
P = Prob(\mid w_{j,k} \mid \ < \ \tau \mid {\cal H}_0)  
\end{eqnarray}
The detection threshold, $\tau$, is defined for each scale. Given an estimation threshold, $\epsilon$, 
if $P = P(\tau) > \epsilon$ the null hypothesis is not excluded. Although non-null, the value of the 
coefficient could be due to noise. On the other hand, if $P < \epsilon$, the coefficient value cannot be due to 
the noise alone, and so the null hypothesis is rejected. In this case, a significant coefficient has been detected.

\subsection{Noise Modeling}
\index{noise}
\index{noise!Gaussian}
If the distribution of $w_{j,l}$ is Gaussian, with zero mean and standard deviation $\sigma_j$, we have the probability density
\begin{eqnarray}
p(w_{j,l}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_j} e^{{- w_{j,l}^2}/2\sigma^2_j} 
\end{eqnarray}
Rejection of hypothesis ${\cal H}_0$ depends (for a positive coefficient value) on:
\begin{eqnarray}
P = Prob( w_{j,l} > W) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_j} \int^{+\infty}_{w_{j,l}} e^{-W^2/2\sigma^2_j} dW 
\end{eqnarray}
and if the coefficient value is negative, it depends on 
\begin{eqnarray}
P = Prob( w_{j,l} < W) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_j} \int^{w_{j,l}}_{-\infty} e^{-W^2/2\sigma^2_j} dW 
\end{eqnarray}

Given stationary Gaussian noise, it suffices to compare $w_{j,l}$ to 
\index{stationary signal}
$k \sigma_j$.  Often $k $ is chosen as 3, which corresponds approximately to $\epsilon = 0.002$.  
If $w_{j,l}$ is small, it is not significant and could be due to noise. If $w_{j,l}$ is large, it is significant:
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{l}
\mbox{ if }  \mid  w_{j,l} \mid \ \geq \ k \sigma_j \ \ \mbox{ then } w_{j,l}   \mbox{ is significant } \\ 
\mbox{ if }  \mid  w_{j,l} \mid \ < \ k \sigma_j \ \ \mbox{ then }  w_{j,l} \mbox{ is not significant }
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}

So we need to estimate, in the case of Gaussian noise models, the noise standard deviation at each scale. 
These standard deviations can be determined analytically, but the calculations can become complicated.  

The appropriate value of $\sigma_j$ in the succession of wavelet planes is assessed from the standard deviation 
of the noise $\sigma_N$ in the original data $D$, and from study of the noise in the wavelet space. This study 
consists of simulating a data set containing Gaussian noise with a standard deviation equal to 1, and taking the 
wavelet transform of this data set. Then we compute the standard deviation $\sigma^e_j$ at each scale. We get a curve 
$\sigma^e_j$ as a function of $j$, giving the behavior of the noise in the wavelet space (Note that if we had used 
an orthogonal wavelet transform, this curve would be linear). Due to the properties of the wavelet (resp. curvelet) 
transform, we have $ \sigma_j = \sigma_N \sigma^e_j $. The noise standard deviation at scale $j$ of the data is equal 
to the noise standard deviation $\sigma_N$ multiplied by the noise standard deviation at scale $j$ of the simulated data.

\subsection{Automatic Estimation of Gaussian Noise}
\subsubsection{$k$-sigma clipping}
\index{sigma clipping}
\index{noise!sigma clipping}
\index{noise}
The Gaussian noise $\sigma_N$ can be estimated automatically in a data set $D$. This estimation is particularly important, 
because all the noise standard deviations $\sigma_j$ in the scales $j$ are derived from $\sigma_N$. Thus an error associated 
with $\sigma_N$ will introduce an error on all $\sigma_j$. Noise is therefore more usefully estimated in the high frequencies, 
where it dominates the signal. The resulting method consists first of filtering the data $D$ with an average filter or the 
median filter and subtracting from $D$ the filtered signal $F$: $S = D - F $. In our case, we replace $S$ by the first scale 
of the wavelet transform ($S = w_1$), which is more convenient from the computation time point of view. The histogram of $S$ 
shows a Gaussian peak around 0. A k-sigma clipping is then used to reject pixels where the signal is significantly large. 
We denote $S^{(1)}$ the subset of $S$ which contains only the pixels such that $\mid S_l \mid \ < k \sigma_S$, where $\sigma_S$ 
is the standard deviation of $S$, and $k$ is a constant generally chosen equal to 3. By iterating, we obtain the subset $S^{(n+1)}$ 
verifying $\mid S^{(n)}_l \mid \ < k \sigma_{S^{(n)}}$, where $\sigma_{S^{(n)}}$ is the noise standard deviation of $S^{(n)}$. 
Robust estimation of the noise $\sigma_1$ in $w_1$ (as $S = w_1$) is now obtained by calculation of the standard deviation of 
$S^{(n)}$ ($\sigma_1 = \sigma_{S^{(n)}}$). In practice, three iterations are enough, and accuracy is generally better than $5$\%.
$\sigma_N$ is finally calculated by: 
\be
\sigma_N = \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma^e_1} = \frac{\sigma_{S^{(n)}} }{\sigma^e_1}
\ee


\subsection{Correlated Noise}
\index{median!median absolute deviation}
\index{MAD}
\index{noise!median absolute deviation}
\index{noise}
In this case, the data can be treated as for the Gaussian case, but the noise standard deviation $\sigma_j$ at scale $j$ 
is calculated independently at each scale. Two methods can be used: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sigma_j$ can be derived from a k-sigma clipping method applied at scale $j$.
\item The median absolute deviation, MAD, can be used as an estimator of the noise standard deviation:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_j = \mbox{median}( \mid w_j \mid ) / 0.6745
\end{eqnarray}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Thresholding}
Many filtering methods have been proposed in the last ten years. {\em Hard thresholding} consists of setting to 0 all 
wavelet coefficients which have an absolute value lower than a threshold $T_j$ (non-significant wavelet coefficient):
\begin{eqnarray}  \tilde w_{j,k} = 
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} w_{j,k} &  \mbox{ if } \mid w_{j,k} \mid \geq T_j  \nonumber  \\ 

0 &  \mbox{ otherwise}  \end{array} \right. 
\end{eqnarray}
where $w_{j,k}$ is a wavelet coefficient at scale $j$ and at spatial position $k$. 

{\em Soft thresholding} consists of replacing each wavelet coefficient by the value $\tilde w$ where
\begin{eqnarray}  \tilde w_{j,k} = 
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} sgn(w_{j,k}) ( \mid w_{j,k} \mid - T_j)    &  \mbox{ if } \mid w_{j,k} \mid \geq T_j \nonumber  \\ 
0 &  \mbox{ otherwise}  \end{array} \right. 
\end{eqnarray} 
This operation is generally written as:
\begin{eqnarray} 
 \tilde w_{j,k} = \mathrm{soft}( w_{j,k})  = sgn(w_{j,k}) ( \mid w_{j,k} \mid - T_j)_{+}
\end{eqnarray} 
where $(x)_{+} = MAX(0,x)$.

When the discrete orthogonal wavelet transform is used instead of the \`a trous algorithm, it is interesting to note
that the hard and soft thresholded estimators are solutions of the following minimization problems:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \tilde w  =   \mathrm{arg}_w \min {1 \over 2} \parallel D - {\cal W}^{-1} w \parallel^2_{l^2} + 
 \lambda \parallel w \parallel^2_{l^0} & & \mbox{\bf   hard threshold} \nonumber \\
  \tilde w   =   \mathrm{arg}_w \min {1 \over 2} \parallel D - {\cal W}^{-1} w \parallel^2_{l^2} + 
 \lambda \parallel w \parallel^2_{l^1} & & \mbox{\bf   soft threshold}  
\end{eqnarray*}
where $D$ is the input data, ${\cal W}$ the wavelet transform operator, and $l^0$ indicates the limit of $l^\delta$ 
when $\delta \rightarrow 0$. This counts in fact the number of non-zero elements in the sequence.
\index{thresholding!hard}
\index{thresholding!soft}
\index{wavelet!hard threshold}
\index{wavelet!soft threshold}

As described before, in the case of Gaussian noise, $T_j = K \sigma_j$, where $j$ is the scale of the wavelet coefficient, 
$\sigma_j$ is the noise standard deviation at the scale $j$, and $K$ is a constant generally chosen equal to 3.

Other threshold methods have been proposed, like the {\em universal threshold} 
\index{universal threshold}
\index{SURE}
\index{thresholding!universal threshold}
\index{thresholding!SURE}
\cite{rest:donoho93_1,rest:donoho93_2}, or the SURE (Stein Unbiased Risk Estimate) method \cite{rest:donoho95},
but they generally do not yield as good results as the hard thresholding method based on the significant coefficients.  
For astronomical data, soft thresholding should never be used because it leads to a photometry loss associated with all 
objects, which can easily be verified by looking at the residual map (i.e.\ data $-$ filtered data). Concerning the 
threshold level, the universal threshold  corresponds to a minimum risk. The larger the number of pixels, the larger 
is the risk, and it is normal that the threshold $T$ depends on the number of pixels ($T = \sqrt{2\log n} \sigma_j$, 
$n$ being the number of pixels). The $K\sigma$ threshold corresponds to a false detection probability, the probability 
to detect a coefficient as significant when it is due to the noise. The $3\sigma$ value corresponds to 0.27 \% false detection.

features, the curvelets produces better results than the wavelets.

Although the results obtained by simply thresholding the curvelet expansion are encouraging, there is of course ample room for further
improvement. A quick inspection of the residual images for both the wavelet and curvelet transforms shown in Figure~\ref{Figure:sync_filter}
reveals the existence of very different features. For instance, wavelets do not restore long features with high fidelity while curvelets
are seriously challenged by isotropic or small features. Each transform has its own area of expertise and this complementarity is of great 
potential. The Combined Filtering Method (CFM) \cite{starck:spie01a} allows us to benefit from the advantages of both transforms. This iterative 
method detects the significant coefficients in both the wavelet domain and the curvelet domain and guarantees that the reconstructed map will 
take into account any pattern which is detected as significant by either of the transforms. A full description of the algorithm is given in Appendix B.
Figure~\ref{Figure:sync_cbf_filter} shows the CFM denoised image and its residual. { Figure~\ref{Figure:sync_face_cbf_filter} shows one face 
(face 6) of the following Healpix images: upper left, original image; upper right, noisy image; middle left, restored image after denoising 
by the combined transform; middle right, the residual; bottom left and right, the residual using respectively the curvelet and the wavelet 
denoising method. } The results are reported in Table~\ref{comptab_sync}. The residual is much better when the combined filtering is applied, 
and no feature can be detected any more by eye in the residual. This was not the case for either the wavelet and the curvelet filtering.
