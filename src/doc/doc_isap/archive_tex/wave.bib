This paper concentrates on                 the estimation of functions and images from noisy data                 by using wavelet shrinkage. A modified form of twofold                 cross-validation is introduced to choose a threshold                 for wavelet shrinkage estimators operating on data sets                 of length a power of 2. The cross-validation algorithm                 is then extended to data sets of any length and to                 multidimensional data sets.The algorithms are compared                 with established threshold choosers by using                 simulation.

It                 permits efficient compression of a variety of signals,                 such as sound and images. The predefined libraries of                 modulated waveforms include orthogonal wavelet-packets                 and localized trigonometric functions, and have                 reasonably well-controlled time-frequency localization                 properties. The idea is to build out of the library                 functions an orthonormal basis relative to which the                 given signal or collection of signals has the lowest                 information cost. The method relies heavily on the                 remarkable orthogonality properties of the new                 libraries: all expansions in a given library conserve                 energy and are thus comparable. Several cost                 functionals are useful; one of the most attractive is                 Shannon entropy, which has a geometric interpretation                 in this context.",}@article{wave:claypoole00,    author = {R.
